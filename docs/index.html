            <h3>MoodFlix</h3>
            <p>
                As part of a Software Engineering course project, I designed and developed <strong>MoodFlix</strong>, a web application that recommends movies based on user emotions. This project leverages advanced machine learning techniques, including <strong>Wav2Vec</strong> for speech-to-emotion recognition and <strong>BGE-Large embeddings</strong> for text analysis. By integrating the <strong>IMDB database</strong>, MoodFlix delivers highly personalized movie recommendations with an accuracy of <strong>87%</strong>.<br><br>
        
                The web interface, built using <strong>Flask</strong>, supports multiple input methods including speech, text, and AI chat ensuring a seamless user experience. The system optimizes recommendation relevance, reducing incorrect suggestions by <strong>28%</strong>. This project showcases my expertise in machine learning, natural language processing, and web application development.<br><br>
        
                A <strong>demo video</strong> of MoodFlix is available in the project's GitHub repository.

            <h3>Video Analysis (Crack Detection)</h3>
            <p>
                Under the guidance of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pratik-mazumder-553a8567/?originalSubdomain=in" target="_blank">Prof. Pratik Mazumdar</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sumit-kalra-97a06933/?originalSubdomain=in" target="_blank">Prof. Sumit Kalra</a>, I did a project in Machine Learning, focusing on <strong>crack detection</strong> in walls. Scheduled for completion in December 2024, this project utilizes <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>Deep Learning</strong>, <strong>YOLOv11</strong>, and <strong>OpenCV</strong> to develop a model capable of drawing bounding boxes around cracks with an <strong>mAP50-95 of approximately 0.5608</strong>.<br><br>

                The project involves training a <strong>YOLOv11-based detection model</strong> on a specialized dataset, incorporating <strong>image preprocessing, model training, and evaluation</strong> to ensure high accuracy. More details, including the source code and a demo video, are available in the GitHub README file, highlighting my expertise in <strong>computer vision</strong> and <strong>deep learning</strong> applications.</p>

            <h3>PathFinder</h3>
            <p>
                Under the guidance of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dipsankar/?originalSubdomain=in" target="_blank">Prof. Deep Shankar Banerjee</a>, I did a project in <strong>Data Structures</strong> and <strong>Algorithms (DSA)</strong>, focusing on building an efficient <strong>pathfinding system</strong>. Scheduled for completion in November 2024, this project utilizes <strong>C++</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, and <strong>Docker</strong> to implement an optimized <strong>Dijkstra's algorithm</strong> for large-scale network analysis with a <strong>real-time visualization interface</strong>.<br><br>

                The project involves using complex <strong>graph data structures</strong> to represent locations and paths effectively. The web interface, developed with <strong>JavaScript</strong>, provides interactive real-time visualization of the pathfinding process. To ensure smooth deployment across different environments, the application is containerized using <strong>Docker</strong>. This project highlights my strong grasp of <strong>DSA</strong>, <strong>algorithm optimization</strong>, and <strong>web-based system development</strong> using modern technologies.

            <h3>Self Driving Model</h3>
            <p>
                Self-Learning Project in <strong>Machine Learning</strong> & <strong>Deep Learning</strong>
                I have worked on an autonomous system using <strong>Machine Learning</strong> to control keyboard inputs for driving cars in Grand Theft Auto V (GTAV). Scheduled for completion in April 2024, this project utilizes <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>TensorFlow</strong>, and <strong>AlexNet CNN</strong> to process game data and make real-time driving decisions, achieving a good average precision.<br><br>
                
                The model is trained using <strong>AlexNet CNN</strong> to recognize patterns and predict the best driving actions. The system interacts with the game through direct keyboard inputs, simulating human-like control. More details, including the source code, are available on GitHub, demonstrating my skills in <strong>deep learning</strong>, <strong>reinforcement learning</strong>, and <strong>AI-driven automation</strong>.</p>

            <h3>Road Safety Model</h3>
            <p>
                To address road accidents caused by blind spots, we developed a smart detection system using <strong>Machine Learning</strong> and embedded systems. This project utilized <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>Raspberry Pi Pico</strong>, <strong>microPython</strong>, <strong>YOLOv7</strong>, and <strong>PyTorch</strong> to detect nearby vehicles and trigger an alert signal, enhancing driver awareness.<br><br>

                We implemented a <strong>YOLOv7 pretrained model</strong>, which accurately detected cars in real time and activated an alert with <strong>96% accuracy</strong>. By integrating <strong>AI</strong> with embedded hardware, this system provided a practical safety solution for road users.
