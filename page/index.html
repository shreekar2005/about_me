            <p><a href="myCV2_2_4.pdf" target="_blank">Resume</a></p>
            I am a passionate Computer Science student at IIT Jodhpur with a strong interest in software development, machine learning, and algorithm optimization. My experience spans across deep learning, computer vision, and web technologies, with projects ranging from AI-powered crack detection using YOLOv11 to an autonomous driving system in GTA V using TensorFlow and AlexNet CNN. I have also worked on pathfinding algorithms, optimizing Dijkstra’s algorithm for large-scale network analysis with a real-time visualization web application. Additionally, I have developed a blind spot detection system using YOLOv7 and Raspberry Pi Pico to improve road safety and a financial transaction management system in C using file handling.<br><br>

            Beyond tech, I am an active Design Team/Core member in Sangam (Music Society), IIT Jodhpur and a dedicated flautist, having delivered over 15 performances at prestigious competitions like InterIITs. My passion for music production has led me to create and produce tracks using FL Studio, applying advanced mixing techniques to enhance sound quality. Always eager to learn and innovate, I strive to build scalable, practical solutions and make meaningful contributions in technology and creative fields.</p>

            <h3>Video Analysis (Crack Detection)</h3>
            <p>
                Under the guidance of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pratik-mazumder-553a8567/?originalSubdomain=in" target="_blank">Prof. Pratik Mazumdar</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sumit-kalra-97a06933/?originalSubdomain=in" target="_blank">Prof. Sumit Kalra</a>, I did a project in Machine Learning, focusing on crack detection in walls. Scheduled for completion in December 2024, this project utilizes Python, Deep Learning, YOLOv11, and OpenCV to develop a model capable of drawing bounding boxes around cracks with an mAP50-95 of approximately 0.5608.<br><br>

                The project involves training a YOLOv11-based detection model on a specialized dataset, incorporating image preprocessing, model training, and evaluation to ensure high accuracy. More details, including the source code and a demo video, are available in the GitHub README file, highlighting my expertise in computer vision and deep learning applications.</p>

            <h3>PathFinder</h3>
            <p>
                Under the guidance of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dipsankar/?originalSubdomain=in" target="_blank">Prof. Deep Shankar Banerjee</a>, I did a project in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), focusing on building an efficient pathfinding system. Scheduled for completion in November 2024, this project utilizes C++, JavaScript, and Docker to implement an optimized Dijkstra's algorithm for large-scale network analysis with a real-time visualization interface.<br><br>

                The project involves using complex graph data structures to represent locations and paths effectively. The web interface, developed with JavaScript, provides interactive real-time visualization of the pathfinding process. To ensure smooth deployment across different environments, the application is containerized using Docker. This project highlights my strong grasp of DSA, algorithm optimization, and web-based system development using modern technologies.

            <h3>Self Driving Model</h3>
            <p>
                Self-Learning Project in Machine Learning & Deep Learning
                I have worked on an autonomous system using Machine Learning to control keyboard inputs for driving cars in Grand Theft Auto V (GTAV). Scheduled for completion in April 2024, this project utilizes Python, TensorFlow, and AlexNet CNN to process game data and make real-time driving decisions, achieving an good average precision.<br><br>
                
                The model is trained using AlexNet CNN to recognize patterns and predict the best driving actions. The system interacts with the game through direct keyboard inputs, simulating human-like control. More details, including the source code, are available on GitHub, demonstrating my skills in deep learning, reinforcement learning, and AI-driven automation.</p>

            <h3>Road Safety Model</h3>
            <p>
                To address road accidents caused by blind spots, we developed a smart detection system using Machine Learning and embedded systems. This project utilized Python, Raspberry Pi Pico, microPython, YOLOv7, and PyTorch to detect nearby vehicles and trigger an alert signal, enhancing driver awareness.<br><br>

                We implemented a YOLOv7 pretrained model, which accurately detected cars in real time and activated an alert with 96% accuracy. By integrating AI with embedded hardware, this system provided a practical safety solution for road users.
